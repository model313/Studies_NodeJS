# Express.js?
Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides tools and features to build web and API servers quickly, such as routing, middleware support, and HTTP utility methods.

As apposed to using the Node's HTTP module and setting up controllers for each resource, Express.js provides a more efficient way to handle a web app.


# Setup
Default:
```npm install express --save```

Version:
```npm install express@4.17.1 --save```
