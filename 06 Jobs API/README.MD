## 💡 How to Run

1. Clone the entire repo ('Studies_NodeJS')
2. Navigate to folder '04 Store API' using the terminal of your choice
3. Install dependencies 
    `npm install`
    
4. Set up your `.env` file with your MongoDB URI
    `MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string`
    
5. Start the server  
    `npm start`
    
6. Use Postman and interact with the API!
