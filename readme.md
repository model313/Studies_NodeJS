# Node.js Study Notes

I have an upcoming project that requires Node.js.

This repository contains my personal study notes, practice code, and mini-projects as I learn Node.js.

I have begun my studies by watching John Smilga's course on a Youtube channel called 'freeCodeCamp.org'. Highly recommended.

Most of this code will be reference notes based off John Smilgas course.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Included

- Core topics covered by John Smilga
- Core concepts of Node.js (e.g., event loop, modules, file system)
- Practice scripts and examples
- Notes and summaries from tutorials or courses
- Small hands-on projects

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

The goal of this repo is to deepen my understanding of Node.js by writing code, experimenting with modules, and documenting what I learn for future reference.
